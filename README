--:: ABOUT ::--

This is a tool that automatically identifies whatever raid you're hitting at
the time and display a convenient tooltip that indicates that raid's
AP (if applicable), Optimal Share, Maximal Share, and other relevent tiers.

I wrote this because ShortStabber asked and I was also really tired of looking
up tier data, especially for raids that tend to move fairly quickly or such
raids get posted to the chat while I'm not looking there.

________________________________
--:: INSTALLATION AND USAGE ::--

You'll need AutoHotkey 1.1.* (also known as AutoHotkey_L) installed on your
machine in order to run my script. You can get it from this page:

https://autohotkey.com/download/1.1/

You'll want to download the the installer file that is closest to the top.
That's how you'll know you're getting the latest version of AutoHotkey 1.1.*
Make sure that .ahk files are associated with AutoHotkey and that
double-clicking them runs the script instead of edits them.

To start the script, double-click main.ahk.
If you don't see anything immediately happen, that's normal.
You can see it in the task tray where a little green "H" icon is. That's me!

This script is controlled via keyboard shortcuts. The controls:

F1 = Turn on/off raid monitoring.
F2 = (Debug only!) Add new raid to database
F3 = (Debug only!) Reserved for testing purposes
F4 = Exit the application

Now, open up Dawn of the Dragons (if you aren't already playing) and
enter any raid. If the script recognizes the raid graphics, it should
display tier information about it in tooltips just below the magics.

--:: SYMBOLS USED IN THE TIER LIST ::--

  ^  Indicates AP. The minimum damage needed to obtain achievement credit.
  *  Indicates OS. This is the best (or optimal) loot per damage.
     Some raids have more than one.
  k  thousand (kilo). Example: 140k = 140,000. Rarely-used.
  m  million. Example: 3.4m = 3,400,000.
  b  billion. Example: 1.5b = 1,500,000,000.
  t  trillion. Example: 5t = 5,000,000,000,000. Not often used at the moment.
  q  quadrillion. No. You don't get an example. This actually isn't used
     in any tier listings, and I hope it never does.

--:: ADDING RAIDS AND DATABASE MAINTENANCE ::--

0. There is no database merge tool. If you replace raiddb.dat with any updated
   versions of my script, you will lose all progress. Also, don't quickly cycle
   the script or do anything too fast. There has been reports of the database
   being eaten (truncated) by the script, so keep a backup at all times. 
   
1. Your script must be in DEBUG mode. Create an empty file named DEBUG in the
   directory and re-run the script to put it into debug mode.
   
2. Push F1 to toggle on the raid monitor.
   Enter any raid and wait for the raid graphics to load.
   If the tier tooltip is incorrect or doesn't display, continue.
   
3. Push F2 to bring up the editor dialog. Once the dialog appears, the raid's
   identifying pixels will have been recorded. You can continue to play the game
   or you can start editing raid/tier information in the dialog.
   
4. Scan the database to see if the raid is already there.
   Some names may be abbreviated or be called other things. Check carefully.
   If it is there, click it and the name/data fields will fill out.
   If it is not, enter the data in the name/data fields, then click Add/Update
   
5. Some raids share graphics with another raid.
   Do step (4) anyway and all matching raids will display.
   You can check (and click) in the "Raid graphics also shared with" list.
   
6. If you mess something up, you can open raiddb.dat in a text editor and
   delete the offending lines. The database is a plaintext CSV file formatted:
   pixelcolor1, pixelcolor2, pixelcolor3, raidname, raidtier

7. You can optionally sort the database by raid name by running dbsort.py
   You'll need Python 2.7.* installed before you can run that script.
   Apologies for the additional requirements.

--:: TROUBLESHOOTING ::--

Q1: How do I get this script to run in Linux/OSX/(insert any non-Windows OS)
A1: You don't. Sorry >.<
    If you can get IronAHK to work, tell me about it and 
    maybe we can work something out.

Q2: I turned on the monitor but the script isn't (reliably) detecting my raid.
A2: Could be any of the following:
    1. The raid isn't in the database yet.
       Wait for an update or add the data to the database yourself.
    2. You have the game zoomed in.
       Click "Show All" or undo any browser zooming.
    3. The raid graphics is animated.
       Turn off animations.
    4. Desktop and application color depth is less than 24-bit.
       Change to 24-bit (true color) or higher.
       Or get a better video card/computer /then/ try it.

Q3: How do I hide tier information? They're kinda getting in the way.
A3: Push F1 to toggle off the monitor, do your thing, then toggle it back on.
    You can also click on the tooltip to make it go away briefly.

See the plaintext file named LICENSE for more information.

A friend of mine convinced me that having a license is important if I
want people to actually use my work. So I picked the MIT license since
it lets people do just that.

--:: VERSION HISTORY ::--

0.10 - The script seems to work? Left it on debug mode because I still have a
       long way to go in filling out the raid database.
0.11 - Figuring out this Git thing. Added more raids to database since
       version 0.10 (not recorded). Also added a license because I hear that's
       an important thing to have if people are going to be using this tool.
0.12 - Filled in a few gaps in the Z10+ raid coverage, started working on
       newer guild raids.
0.13 - Minor coverage updates in commonly seen Z10+ raids.
       Added more symbols and notes to documentation.
       Added instructions on how to make changes to the raid database.
0.14 - Barely an update. Added slightly more stuff to the database and
       a tip in the documentation about something that always escapes my mind
       until I run into that particular problem again.
0.15 - Added placeholders for most Z1-Z9 raids and their many frames. 
       Added a note about animations and lack of support.
0.16 - Cleaned up icy whelp slobber.
       Set it up so that debug mode is disabled by default. To enable it, create
       a file named "DEBUG" in the same folder as the .ahk file since sometimes
       an end-user database would mysteriously get chewed up.
       Also, db coverage update.
0.17 - Fixed the script to actually anchor the raid tier tooltip relative to the
       home button instead of a constant position that matched where the home
       button was on my machine and setup. Oops.
       Updated the docs to make it more clear where and how to get AutoHotkey.
       Updated db coverage.
0.18 - Docs updated to make db maintenance instructions easier to follow.
       Docs update for special thanks.
       Updated db coverage.
0.19 - Fixed overlapping tooltips issue.
       Updated db coverage and added tiers to placeholders
0.20 - Docs updated to make troubleshooting easier to skim and get help from.
       Program source rearranged for ease of maintenance.
       Tentative non-raid (campaign) support added.
0.21 - Source updated to hopefully prevent db writeback if read incomplete.
       Updated db coverage for raids and some campaign nodes.
0.22 - Reduced size of home.bmp for hopefully improved performance
       Updated db to fix error
0.22a- Undid half the db fix
0.23 - Docs updated to fix typo, headers modified, sections rearranged
       Update db coverage including GD campaign
0.24 - Source updated to fix raid/camp ident problem
       Updated db coverage
0.25 - Updated db coverage
0.26 - Updated db coverage
0.27 - Updated db coverage, fixes

--:: SPECIAL THANKS ::--

Dusan, Idrinth, and Warric for their inline tier script, from where most
of the raid tier data was transcribed.

ShortStabber. Their interest in the and the desire (both SS' and mine)
for something easier than actually having to look up tiers and potentially
missing fast-moving raids. 

blub. For beta testing and being such an awesome guild leader.
And for caring for my horde of icy whelps while I'm off raiding.
