--:: ABOUT ::--

This is a tool that automatically identifies whatever raid you're hitting at
the time and display a convenient tooltip that indicates that raid's
AP (if applicable), Optimal Share, Maximal Share, and other relevent tiers.

I wrote this because ShortStabber asked and I was also really tired of looking
up tier data, especially for raids that tend to move fairly quickly or such
raids get posted to the chat while I'm not looking there.

--:: USAGE ::--

You'll need AutoHotkey_L installed. I haven't checked if AHK vanilla works
with it but I built and debugged the script in AutoHotkey ANSI 32-bit
version 1.1.22.7. During installation, you need to have .ahk files associated
with AutoHotkey so you can run my script.

To start the script, double-click main.ahk.
If you don't see anything immediately happen, that's normal.
You can see it in the task tray where a little green "H" icon is. That's me!

This script is controlled via keyboard shortcuts. The controls:

F1 = Turn on/off raid monitoring.
F2 = (Debug only!) Add new raid to database
F3 = (Debug only!) Reserved for testing purposes
F4 = Exit the application

Now, open up Dawn of the Dragons (if you aren't already playing) and
enter any raid. If the script recognizes the raid graphics, it should
display tier information about it in tooltips just below the magics.

--:: ADDING RAIDS TO THE DATABASE AND MAINTAINING IT ::--

Keep in mind that any raids that you add will not be preserved if you have
to download a new version of my script and replace raiddb.dat.
Sorry, I have no way to merge databases yet.

When you enter a raid that does not pop up with a tier listing, push F2 to
bring up the database editor tool. It will only pop up if the script can
tell that you're actually in a raid.

Once the dialog pops up over the chat area, the pixels needed to identify
that raid has been preserved and you may then proceed to hit the raid if
you need to if you're trying to play the game and add raids to the db at
the same time.

First scan the list to see if the raid isn't already in the database. It's
entirely possible that it's there, but does not recognize that particular
raid background image. Click the name to bring up its tier information.
You may then edit the tier information, or continue by pushing the
Add/Update button. When the box closes, the script is fully updated with
the raid information.

Sometimes raids share graphics with another raid. It is possible to associate
the same graphic with more than one raid. Just give it another name and
tier information, or select a preexisting raid off the database if it already
exists, then click Add/Update.

The raiddb.dat file only updates when the script is fully shut down.
Shut down the script by pushing F4 at any time.

Any new entries that are added are appended to the bottom of the script.
If you mess something up, you can manually delete them here.

In order to sort the script, you'll need Python 2.7.x installed. Once you
get that, you'll need to run dbsort.py. I probably should've done it in
AHK, but it's just far, far easier in Python.

--:: SYMBOLS USED IN THE TIER LIST ::--

  ^  Indicates AP. The minimum damage needed to obtain achievement credit.
  *  Indicates OS. This is the best (or optimal) loot per damage.
     Some raids have more than one.
  k  thousand (kilo). Example: 140k = 140,000. Rarely-used.
  m  million. Example: 3.4m = 3,400,000.
  b  billion. Example: 1.5b = 1,500,000,000.
  t  trillion. Example: 5t = 5,000,000,000,000. Not often used at the moment.
  q  quadrillion. No. You don't get an example. This actually isn't used
     in any tier listings, and I hope it never does.

--:: VERSION HISTORY ::--

0.10 - The script seems to work? Left it on debug mode because I still have a
       long way to go in filling out the raid database.
0.11 - Figuring out this Git thing. Added more raids to database since
       version 0.10 (not recorded). Also added a license because I hear that's
       an important thing to have if people are going to be using this tool.
0.12 - Filled in a few gaps in the Z10+ raid coverage, started working on
       newer guild raids.
0.13 - Minor coverage updates in commonly seen Z10+ raids.
       Added more symbols and notes to documentation.
       Added instructions on how to make changes to the raid database.
0.14 - Barely an update. Added slightly more stuff to the database and
       a tip in the documentation about something that always escapes my mind
       until I run into that particular problem again.
0.15 - Added placeholders for most Z1-Z9 raids and their many frames. 
       Added a note about animations and lack of support.
0.16 - Cleaned up icy whelp slobber.
       Set it up so that debug mode is disabled by default. To enable it, create
       a file named "DEBUG" in the same folder as the .ahk file since sometimes
       an end-user database would mysteriously get chewed up.
       Also, db coverage update.

--:: NOTES AND TROUBLESHOOTING ::--

This is a Windows-only tool. Sorry *nix, Mac people. Was never able to figure
out how to get IronAHK to work for cross-platform compatibility.

Also, the script expects all color depths to be at least 24 bit. Detection
runs the risk of failing otherwise.

DO NOT ZOOM IN. The script expects everything to be at 100% zoom.
If you want it to work with zoom, you'll need to resample home.bmp to the
exact zoom you play the game at, resample the entire raid database, and
hope to whatever deity you pray to that the color interpolation algorithm
used to smooth out pixels in your zoomed state doesn't change behind
your back. Too much work.

DISABLE ANIMATIONS. Some raids are animated. We don't put any animated frames
into the database and I'm not really sure that's possible. At least, not
without some serious frame-by-frame dedication. Too much work.

Campaigns aren't supported yet. For now, you'll end up with some false
positives for campaign bosses such as Horthania and Imryx.

Sometimes the tier information covers up stuff on the raid window that you
need to see or click, such as campaign modifiers or the quick legion/item set
change panel. You should be able to click the tooltip to dismiss it for half
a second. I know it isn't that long but it's better than constantly stopping
and restarting the monitor. I'll probably make it so that it'll go away
temporarily if any tooltip is being hovered over. Something to do, I suppose?

See the plaintext file named LICENSE for more information.

A friend of mine convinced me that having a license is important if I
want people to actually use my work. So I picked the MIT license since
it lets people do just that.

--:: SPECIAL THANKS ::--

Dusan, Idrinth, and Warric for their inline tier script, from where most
of the raid tier data was transcribed.

ShortStabber. Their interest in the and the desire (both SS' and mine)
for soemthing easier than actually having to look up tiers and potentially
missing fast-moving raids.
