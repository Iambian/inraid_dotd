DotD In-Raid Tier Display Tool
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
_______________
--:: ABOUT ::--

This is a tool that automatically identifies whatever raid you're hitting at
the time and display a convenient tooltip that indicates that raid's
AP (if applicable), Optimal Share, Maximal Share, and other relevent tiers.

I wrote this because ShortStabber asked and I was also really tired of looking
up tier data, especially for raids that tend to move fairly quickly or such
raids get posted to the chat while I'm not looking there.

--:: USAGE ::--

You'll need AutoHotkey_L installed. I haven't checked if AHK vanilla works with
it but I built and debugged the script in AutoHotkey ANSI 32-bit v 1.1.22.7
During installation, you need to have .ahk files associated with it
so you can run my script.

To start the script, double-click main.ahk.
If you don't see anything immediately happen, that's normal.
You can see it in the task tray where a little green "H" icon is. That's me!

This script is controlled via keyboard shortcuts. The controls:

F1 = Turn on/off raid monitoring.
F2 = (Debug only!) Add new raid to database
F4 = Exit the application

--:: VERSION HISTORY ::--

0.10 - The script seems to work? Left it on debug mode because I still have a
       long way to go in filling out the raid database.

--:: NOTES ::--

This is a Windows-only tool. Sorry *nix, Mac people. Was never able to figure
out how to get IronAHK to work for cross-platform compatibility.

Also, the script expects all color depths to be at least 24 bit. Detection
runs the risk of failing otherwise.

--:: SPECIAL THANKS ::--

Dusan, Idrinth, and Warric for their inline tier script, from where most of the
raid tier data was transcribed.

ShortStabber. Their interest in the and the desire (both SS' and mine)
for soemthing easier than actually having to look up tiers and potentially
missing fast-moving raids.
